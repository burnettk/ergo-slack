# ergo-slack

Chrome extension for slack that allows you to mash one key on the home row over and over again (d, for 'do it') to read all of your messages.

If you are into this sort of thing, https://refined.chat/ is perhaps the most full-featured slack browser extension.

hot-reload.js is from https://stackoverflow.com/a/40454227/6090676, and is just
for development purposes.
